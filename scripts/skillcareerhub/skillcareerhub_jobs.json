You'll help build the core AI workflows powering our tutoring product—especially agentic tutoring systems—and harden them into production-grade, scalable, observable systems.\n\nThis role is intentionally not for everyone. If you want tight scope, predictable tasks, or 'only research / only backend,' this won't fit. If you like building real systems end-to-end and seeing your work hit production quickly, you'll love it.\n\nWhat You'll Build:\n\n1. Agentic Tutoring Flows:\n- Hinting systems\n- Step-by-step guidance\n- Misconception detection\n\n2. Answer Evaluation:\n- Grading systems\n- Feedback loops\n\n3. Retrieval + Grounding:\n- Content ingestion\n- Chunking, embedding, re-ranking\n\n4. Personalization:\n- Student memory\n- Progress signals\n- Difficulty adaptation\n\n5. Multimodal Pipelines:\n- Images/diagrams\n- Voice (bonus)\n\nTurn Prototypes → Production:\n- Latency + cost optimization (caching, batching, streaming, fallbacks)\n- Eval-driven iteration (offline test sets, regression checks, quality gates)\n- Observability (traces, logs, metrics, prompt/version tracking)\n- Reliability + safety (guardrails, refusal behavior, age-appropriate output)\n\nOwn Features End-to-End:\n- From rough PRD → implementation → deployment → monitoring → iteration\n- Collaborate with product/design/education teams\n\nNOTE: This is ON-SITE in Bangalore only. Not remote/hybrid.\n\n=== Requirements ===\n• Strong Python fundamentals - clean code and 'hack' when needed (MUST HAVE)\n• Comfortable building services with FastAPI/Flask, writing APIs, debugging production (MUST HAVE)\n• Practical understanding of Docker, local dev workflows, basic deployment (MUST HAVE)\n• Good CS foundations (data structures, systems thinking, debugging) (MUST HAVE)\n• Hands-on experience with OpenAI SDK / LangChain / Haystack or similar LLM framework (MUST HAVE)\n• Understand: prompting vs tooling vs retrieval vs agents vs evals (MUST HAVE)\n• Built something real: internships, projects, shipped side projects, research, or OSS (MUST HAVE)\n• CS background preferred or equivalent demonstrated capability\n• Strong signal from top engineering programs in India or equivalent track record\n• Default to ownership - don't wait to be told every step\n• Can move fast without being sloppy\n• Enjoy ambiguity and turn it into clear execution\n• Treat quality as engineering problem: tests, evals, instrumentation, iteration\n• Willing to work ON-SITE in Bangalore (no remote/hybrid)\n\n=== Benefits ===\n• Build core AI product (not demos) used by students daily\n• Massive scope for learning: agents, evals, multimodal tutoring, production hardening\n• Small team, high trust, direct impact—your code ships and matters\n• Work with team that cares about craft, not just hype\n• Led by legendary founders: Mukesh Bansal (Myntra, CureFit) & Peeyush Ranjan (Google VP, CTO-Flipkart, Airbnb)\n• Reshape how millions of students learn\n• Democratize world-class tutoring through AI\n• High-velocity environment prioritizing impact, ownership, direct collaboration\n• End-to-end feature ownership (PRD to production)\n• Real production systems at scale\n• Define and build future of AI in education",
